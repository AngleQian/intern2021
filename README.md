# Journey
Journey is a learning experience running on [.NET Interactive Notebooks](https://github.com/dotnet/interactive) where teachers can design a step-by-step path for students. Along the student's journey, teachers can create challenges, provide customized feedback, and define rules to continue.

## About Journey
We believe that the journey towards a goal is one of the most crucial aspects of learning. As students, we wanted to create an engaging notebook experience for the classroom that utilized this idea. 
Currently, Journey supports the following features:
- Defining rules and challenges
- Programatic revealing of cells
- Customized teacher feedback with support for visual libraries
- Re-route a student's path based on their answer
- Access to student submission history
